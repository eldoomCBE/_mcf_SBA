<p>This framework demonstrates how to implement and operationalize a competency framework with <abbr class=""initialism"" title=""Competency-Based Education"">CBE</abbr> or <abbr class=""initialism"" title=""Skill-Based Approach"">SBA</abbr> within Moodle's competency frameworks.<br>It follows a simple 7-steps synthesis of the development stages for competency frameworks including:&nbsp;defining <strong>competencies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>essential components</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>families of situations</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>levels of development</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>critical learnings</strong>,&nbsp;and additional elements in the program like&nbsp;<strong>learning and assessment situations</strong>&nbsp;(LAS) plus necessary&nbsp;<strong>resources&nbsp;</strong>for competency development.</p>
<hr>
<p class=""mb-0"">It contains namings, self-explanations and self-instructions to identify and develop properly each component, which should, of course, not to be presented as it into the end-to-end framework.</p>
